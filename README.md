# Test exercise

## Install

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Possible improvements

* Migrate to strore data in Database like MySQL / MongoDB
* Move code about getting Products, Vendors from routes/controllers to back-end services/models (new layer of abstraction)
* Move code about filtering Products from routes/controllers to back-end service for filtering Products
* Improve Search on front-end - do not send requests to frequently - let's use debounce to deal with that
* Move endpoints URL's to centralized place (better - move it generation to back-end)

## Challenges (most time-eaters tasks)

* `Deploy to Heroku` - I'm using Heroku first time and thatwhy I waste time to deal with building Client application on Heroku - my quick solution is to put built files to Git (I know that I should't do that, sorry)
* `Deal with AndDesign` - If I had more time with this UI Components library - task could be done quicker
